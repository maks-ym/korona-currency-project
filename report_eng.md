## Aim

The purpose of the report is to check the relationship between the average interbank exchange rate 
of selected currencies (USD, EUR, PLN) in relation to the Ukrainian hryvnia based on the data of the 
National Bank of Ukraine and data on Covid-19 used in class.

## Performing analisys

Data on the development of the Covid-19 epidemic in the world and the interbank exchange rate
of selected currencies were compiled and put side to side to find a correlation between them. It was predicted that the 
USD, EUR and PLN exchange rates have increased along with the development of the epidemic due to fluctuations 
on global stock exchanges and the threat of economic crisis. The number of days from the detection of the first 
case in the world is visible on the x-axis. Data range is from January 22 to March 17, 2020.

## Conclusions

Contrary to the assumptions made, it has not been shown that there is a visible correlation between the development of 
the Covid-19 epidemic in the world and the exchange rates in Ukraine. Exchange rates are affected by many more 
factors than can be predicted in a short analysis. It was noted, however, that exchange rates began to change as 
the epidemic spread in Ukraine. The correlation is most noticeable for USD. You can also see that the zloty itself 
depreciated around 50 days since the beginning of the global epidemic. Another issue that may affect this form of 
results is the fact that Covid-19 cases in Ukraine have only started to be diagnosed more leter than in Western and Centeral
Europe. As of 29 March 2020 there are 475 cases, with the number increasing by 119 over the last 24 hours. 
There are already 10 deaths cases. A fuller, better analysis can probably be made after the outbreak, post-factum.
